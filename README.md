#Problem Statement:
In this assignment, you will be applying your knowledge of constructor chaining, the this keyword, encapsulation, method overloading, visibility modifiers, the toString method, and setters and getters. As we get further into the course, we are starting to learn more elements of Object-Oriented Programming. You will create a Frog.java, Fly.java, and Pond.java file that will simulate how they interact with each other in the real world.

#Solution Description
Create files Fly.java, Frog.java, and Pond.java that will simulate how a pond ecosystem works. You will be creating a number of fields and methods for each file. Based on the description given for each variable and method, you will have to decide whether or not the variables/method should be static, and whether it should be private or public. To make these decisions, you should carefully follow the guidelines on these keywords as taught in lecture. In some cases, your program will still function with an incorrect keyword.
You and your group of astronaut friends are on a spaceship! Fun! However, you are not completely sure you can trust some of them... kinda sus... There seems to be a few Impostors onboard, trying to sabotage you and your crew. Your job is to analyze the players and find the impostors before it is too late! The crewmates win if all of the impostors are frozen, and the impostors win if they hold a majority of the unfrozen players (greater than or equal to half). In this assignment, you will be given a partially filled Player.java (see below for more details), and will create Impostor.java, Crewmate.java, RedAstronaut.java, and BlueAstronaut.java. These classes will simulate the gameplay. In addition, you will create a Gameplay.java file that will not be turned in, serving as a driver that can be used to test your code and check its output. To complete this assignment, you will use your knowledge of abstract classes and interfaces.
